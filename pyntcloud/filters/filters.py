    Parameters
    ----------                                    
    r: float
        The radius of the sphere with center on each point. The filter
        will look for the required number of neighboors inside that sphere.    
        
    Returns
    -------
    ror_filter : boolean array
        The boolean mask indicating wherever a point should be keeped or not.
        The size of the boolean mask will be the same as the number of points
        in the Neighbourhood.
        
    Notes
    -----          
    > The distances between each point and his 'k' nearest neighbors that 
        exceed the given 'r' are marked as False.
    
    > The points having any distance marked as False will be trimmed.
    
    The parameter r should be used in order to adjust the filter to
    the desired result.
            
    A LOWER 'r' value will result in a HIGHER number of points trimmed.

    """ Compute a Statistical Outlier Removal filter using the Neighbourhood.

    Parameters
    ----------  
    z_max: float
        The maximum Z score wich determines if the point is an outlier or 
        not.
        
    Returns
    -------
    sor_filter : boolean array
        The boolean mask indicating wherever a point should be keeped or not.
        The size of the boolean mask will be the same as the number of points
        in the Neighbourhood.
        
    Notes
    -----                
    > For each point, the mean of the distances between him and his 'k' nearest 
        neighbors is computed.
    
    > The Z score of those means is computed.
