Pyntcloud is a Python library for reading. modifying and creating 3D point clouds.

The library is still at the planing stage and I hope to launch first relase soon.

You can sniff around the docstrings and code for now.

Instalation is standard:

    git clone https://github.com/daavoo/pyntcloud.git
    cd pyntcloud
    python setup.py install  # or python setup.py develop
