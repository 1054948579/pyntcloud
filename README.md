# 3D Point Clouds in Python

Accurate [3D point clouds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_cloud) can (easily and cheaply) be adquired nowdays from different sources. For example:
- RGB-D devices: [Google Tango](http://get.google.com/tango/), [Microsoft Kinect](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/kinect), etc.
- [Lidar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar).
- [3D reconstruction from multiple images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_reconstruction_from_multiple_images).

Pyntcloud is a Python library for working with 3D point clouds.

The aim of pyntcloud is to provide a way to work with 3D point clouds without more requirements than basic Python scripting knowledge.
