# 3D Point Clouds in Python

Pyntcloud is a Python library for working with 3D point clouds.

## DOCUMENTATION
Documentation based on Jupyter notebooks with interactive tutorials and examples.

### Introduction
Accurate [3D point clouds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_cloud) can (easily and cheaply) be adquired nowdays from different sources. For example:
- RGB-D devices: [Google Tango](http://get.google.com/tango/), [Microsoft Kinect](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/kinect), etc.
- [Lidar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar).
- [3D reconstruction from multiple images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_reconstruction_from_multiple_images).
The aim of [pyntcloud](https://github.com/daavoo/pyntcloud) is to provide a way to work with 3D point clouds using Python in a clear, fluent and simple way.
Here you can find a quick introduction to the two main concepts on wich this library is based:

#### [What is a point cloud](docs/Introduction/what_is_a_point_cloud.ipynb)
#### [What is a PyntCloud](docs/Introduction/what_is_a_PyntCloud.ipynb)

### Reading and Writing point clouds
In order to work with point clouds we need to be able to read and write point cloud data.
Here you can find how we can do this in pyntcloud:
#### [PyntCloud I/O](docs/Reading and Writing/from_file&to_file.ipynb)
#### [Supported file formats](docs/Reading and Writing/supported_file_formats.ipynb)

### Working with scalar fields
Most of the usefull information in a point cloud is associate with it's scalar fields. 
Here you can find how to work scalar fields in pyntcloud:
#### [Adding scalar fields](docs/Scalar Fields/adding_scalar_fields.ipynb)
#### [Avaliable scalar fields](docs/Scalar Fields/avaliable_scalar_fields.ipynb)

### Working with structures
The raw information of the point cloud needs to be structured in some way to enable a lot of different applications and algorithms. 
Here you can find how to work with structures in pyntcloud:
#### [Adding structures](docs/Scalar Fields/adding_scalar_fields.ipynb)
#### [Avaliable structures](docs/Scalar Fields/avaliable_scalar_fields.ipynb)

## SAMPLE DATA 

Inside the folder `docs/data` you can find examples of point clouds in different formats.

## INSTALATION

Version 0.1 will be reslased soon.

Recommended instalation for now:

```
git clone https://github.com/daavoo/pyntcloud.git

cd pyntcloud

python setup.py develop
```
